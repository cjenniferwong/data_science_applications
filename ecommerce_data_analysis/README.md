### Hello world!

This is the result of a take-home in which I was asked to analyze data from an e-commerce company. I feel that these questions touch on skills that are relevant to any company. It forces you to be clear and precise in your definition, and communicate it to different stakeholders so that you can have a common language going forward.

###Questions asked:
#### 1. What are 'strong' products? Please define 'strong' and explain how you would identify these products from the data provided. Are there any recent trends?

I defined strong products as products which experienced high number of sales within its first 14 days since launch. The reasoning behind the 14 days, is to account for any seasonality which might appear over the course of the week. Also, for this specific company, I know that they release new products every week. The additional week allow it to account for the decrease initial hype and excitement.


#### 2. How are the 'strong' users? Are there any channels that we can utilize to take act on?

I defined strong users, as users who constitute much of the sales for the company. Building off the Pareto Principal, I have an intuition that 80% of sales are usually attributed to 20% of the user base. Going forward, I would like to identify the number of sales which makes up the 80% threshold, and use that as a filter to identify my 'strong' users. From then, I will compare how they heard about the company, and see if there is any pattern/distinction between the 'not-strong' users. Assuming there is a difference, I will then make recommendations to the company regarding next steps.

I understand my ultimate goal is to increase revenue. This can be accomplished by finding more power users, or identifying which products generate lots of revenue and increasing those types of products.
